AirBnB Ver.3 Code Review for @jimmythongtran and @iancugniere

New methods in both storage modules seem very clean, explicit, and easy to understand. Seems like it accounted for possible edge cases. No typos found.
For the count method in file_storage, maybe you could return count once after the else statement.
Test cases might have helped to build more solid codes.
